<h2>Parks/Hiking</h2>
<ol>
    <li><span class="one">Jug Bay Wildlife Sanctuary:</span> Jug Bay Wildlife Sanctuary features a set of trails, tours, and outdoor activites that can be enjoyed by the public.

    <li><span class="two">Sugarloaf Mountain State Park:</span> Sugarloaf Mountain is located in Frederick, MD and is a great place to go for a hike. It offers trails for people of all skill levels, allowing anyone to climb to the top of the mountain. The <span class="bold">top offers great views, so be sure to bring your camera</span>. I have only traveled to Sugarloaf once so far, but I enjoyed it and hope to hike it again soon.</li> 
	  <hr>
    <li><span class="three">Cascade Fall at Pastaspco Valley:</span> Patapsco Valley has multiple site locations, meaning the park is not located in one single location. Therefore, there are a number of paths and trails a person can explore. One of my favorite trails is located in Catonsivlle, MD and is <span class="bold"> home to a waterfall known as Cascade Falls</span>.</li>
